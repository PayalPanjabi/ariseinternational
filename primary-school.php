            <h3>Primary School</h3>
            <p>The primary classes follow a CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) curriculum that focuses to build literacy and numeracy in the formative years of children’s schooling. We have collaborated with Oxford Advantage to design a curriculum that seeks to propagate the use Multiple Intelligence approach of Howard Gardener and the pedagogy of Experiential Learning with the focus on building life skills and 21st century skills. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Teaching and learning at the school are designed to be joyful experiences for children.  By making learning fun but meaningful, and increasing a student’s interest, we lay the foundation for developing a lifelong interest in learning. Thus, children are developed and oriented with a readiness to successfully enter middle school with solid foundation of requisite skills set.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Here, the focus is on encouraging enquiry, exploration and on inculcating confidence in key learning skills- reading, writing, listening, speaking, information technology capability, problem-solving, management skills, observation and measurement. Children are encouraged to speak and perform at assemblies, concerts, drama productions, and so gain confidence in their ability to communicate to a wider audience. Children are also encouraged to take part in various competitions and other celebrations organised by the school regularly. They are also encouraged to take part in field trips and community service.
