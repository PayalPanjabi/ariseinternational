            <p>CBSE curriculum with Oxford and ARISE flavour brings to the learners the best of learning in the present world with the goal of developing 21st century skills to prepare children to face the challenges of real world outside the school gates.<br><br> Our curriculum is specially designed keeping the Multiple Intelligences given by Howard Gardner, making each child one with a unique set of intelligences. As per the CBSE guidelines, we follow the assessment method, which presupposes regular study and a high degree of parental support and involvement. Children at ARISE get a fun-filled, stress-free and a healthy environment to grow, which is the need of the hour and the same is the basic ethos of the new curriculum. 
</p>  <br> <p>The syllabus is designed keeping in mind the cognitive, emotional and physical developmental needs of every child. No wonder the CBSE students fare well in the competitive exams. As the attributes of this curriculum are well within the interests of ARISE’s education, we choose to incorporate CBSE curriculum into our school. Further we tap children’s various interest and enhance their skills by providing opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities, clubs and vocational subjects and visual and performing arts.  </p>
