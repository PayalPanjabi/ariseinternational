<p>For AIS children’s safety is of utmost importance. 
    Thus we request all the parents and students to adhere to the following rules and policies:</p>

<p>Under no circumstance are students allowed to go behind or under the buses parked in the school campus. Students are also not allowed to sit in parked buses during school hours. Students should not touch the instrument panel or first aid box, or fire extinguisher in buses.
</P>
<p>Students must make sure that the passage of the bus is clear, and that school bags and other
     belongings are placed properly. Students must keep all parts of their body inside the bus at all
      times.  </p><p> They should not put their hands out even for waving. No item/object should be thrown inside
       or outside the bus during the journey. The consumption of edibles and any kind of drinks other 
       than water is not permitted in the bus. Unruly behavior like shrieking and shouting is strictly
        prohibited. Any misbehavior on part of a student with the bus driver, conductor, bus teacher or 
        another student will be viewed as a grave misdemeanor and lead to suspension from school.

<p>Parents are not allowed to enter the school bus under any circumstance nor is it expected 
        that they get into an argument with the bus teacher/ driver/ conductor. Transport facility of 
        the child may be suspended or even cancelled for any such confrontation reported. The driver’s 
        attention must not be distracted for any reason. The drivers are authorized to stop buses at 
        designated stops only, unless otherwise directed by the bus teacher, 
    after consultation with the Transport In-charge and the Head of School.</p>
<p>The Transport Users Fee, paid at the time of admission, is non-refundable. In case a student discontinues school transport, the fee will not be returned. Also, if a student changes from supervision and begins to avail school transport, the Transport Users Fee should be paid. For all queries / requests regarding transport, parents should approach the Transport In-charge through e-mail to: transport.arise@gmail.com. If the issue remains unaddressed even after five working days, parents should escalate it to the Head of School.</p>
